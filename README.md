# Responsive-Portfolio
 
 This is project is a continuation of my previous project, the [Bootstrap-Portfolio](https://github.com/BAANG/Bootstrap-Portfolio), where my objective was to add responsiveness to my webpages. This was done by utilizing both [@Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) CSS's grid system and including several media queries per different screen resolutions that this webpage may be viewed in.
